# Spotivore â€” A Spotify client for you.

## What is Spotivore?
Spotivore is a custom Spotify desktop client. It's a work in progress that's still in its early stages.

## Why create another Spotify client?
The main purpose for creating Spotivore is to implement features that are missing in Spotify's native client. Here is a list of Spotivore's potential features (note that these are liable to change or not be implemented at all):
  - Playlist nesting: Make one playlist a subset of another playlist, so that all tracks added to it will also be added to the larger list
  - Inter-playlist shuffling: Choose multiple playlists to shuffle seamlessly between
  - Make bookmarks for albums and playlists so you can pick up right where you left off, preserving shuffling order
  - Join tracks together so that one track is always followed by the next, even when shuffled
  - Customizable shuffling behavior: Use fair shuffling or Spotify's weighted shuffling algorithm
  - Set timestamps for a track to always start or end at
  - Add custom tags to tracks that you can filter by and dynamically create playlists from
  - Live "radio" hosted by a single DJ: A user can host a live "station" (listening session) that others can "tune into" (sync up with) and listen to the same music together

Note that implementing new features is a higher priority than reimplementing all of Spotify's exsiting features, particularly those that are less important, so Spotivore may be missing some of the native client's exisiting functionality in favor of shiny new stuff.

Another purpose for this project is to allow me to learn VueJS. That being said, please keep in mind that I'm learning as I go. :)

## That's it!
Keep an eye out for more updates as this project matures!
